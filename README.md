# YouTube Channel Growth & Revenue Analysis
## Executive Summary:
My client’s YouTube channel, active since May 2024, has been stagnating in both growth and revenue. Despite having a wealth of engagement and revenue data, historical patterns were underutilized. Using Python, Tableau, and data analysis techniques, I analyzed the channel’s performance across content type, video duration, and posting schedule.

Key findings showed significant declines in the first half of 2025: net subscribers fell 95.7%, impressions 88.6%, views 86.6%, and revenue 95.2%. Analysis identified that inconsistent upload schedules, low-performing content types, and suboptimal posting times contributed to this decline.

Recommended strategies include optimizing content types, refining video length based on engagement data, and scheduling uploads for maximum impact.

## Business Problem
The YouTube channel’s revenue and audience growth have significantly declined, affecting the client’s business objectives. Stakeholders want to understand:
- Why are engagement and revenue dropping?
- Which content types or strategies drive growth?
- How can we optimize the channel for audience retention and revenue?
  
## Methodology
**Data Structure & Quality Checks:**
- Split channel data into two tables: videos and metrics (95 rows).
- Conducted data validation and consistency checks for accuracy.
  
**Analysis Techniques:**
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
- Tableau dashboard to create an interactive, executive-friendly reporting experience.
- Metrics analyzed: views, impressions, CTR, watch time, revenue, net subscriber growth.
  
**Focus Areas:**
1. Growth Trends Analysis – track historical performance by content type and engagement metrics.
2. Content Type Performance – evaluate short-form vs. long-form content impact.
3. Video Duration Success – examine how length affects engagement and revenue.
4. Scheduling Comparisons – determine optimal posting times for each content type.

## Results & Business Recommendations
**Growth & Revenue Decline:**
- Net subscribers decreased 95.7%, impressions 88.6%, views 86.6%, and revenue 95.2% from peak months (July–August 2024) to early 2025.
- Key drivers of decline: inconsistent uploads, underperforming content types, suboptimal posting times.

**Content Insights:**
- Short-form content drives higher CTR but lower watch time, while long-form content contributes more to revenue.
- Optimal video duration for long-form content is between X–Y minutes (derived from engagement data).

**Scheduling Insights:**
- Posting times strongly influence engagement, with weekends performing X% better for long-form and weekdays for short-form content.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Content Strategy Optimization:** Focus on the high-performing content types identified in the analysis.
2. **Video Length Refinement:** Align long-form content with engagement-driven duration ranges.
3. **Upload Schedule Adjustments:** Publish content at peak engagement times based on data.
4. **Data-Driven Experimentation:** Use A/B testing for titles, thumbnails, and posting strategies to continuously optimize performance.

These steps aim to reverse the declining trend, improve engagement, and maximize revenue while providing the client with actionable insights for sustained growth.
